# ArduinoRFREmote
Code for controlling 433 MHz RF smart devices using Arduino

This code is designed for an Arduino Nano wired directly to the button pins of a RF remote control outlet like this one: https://amzn.to/2L4U73W

We have a tutorial video on YouTube here on how to wire up the Arduino and Remote: https://youtu.be/cPddBy-kb-I

BE SURE TO POWER THE REMOTE AT 5V SO YOU DO NOT BURN OUT YOUR ARDUINO!!

The code can be easily expanded to add additional capabilities and sensors since it is just simulating someone physically pressing the buttons.

I eventually plan to add the ability to control IR remote control lights like these to the library as well: https://amzn.to/2MWraJJ

Some day, I'd also like to add Hue compatibility using an ESP8266
